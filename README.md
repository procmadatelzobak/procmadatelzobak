# Hi, I'm Vojtěch Pszczólka 👋  
**Creative Technologist | Building Worlds Between Code and Imagination**

I don’t really *code* in the traditional sense.  
I *talk* to machines — and they talk back. Together, we build things that live somewhere between logic and dreams.

I work with large language models, automation, and storytelling.  
Most of what I create is written in what I like to call **vibe coding** — using AI as a creative partner, not just a tool.

### 🧩 What I do
- **AI Storytelling & Simulation** – I design interactive worlds and games where players talk to AI characters, like [**ChatMystery**](https://game.chatmystery.com).  
- **AI Infrastructure** – I run local LLM environments using **Proxmox**, **Ollama**, **OpenHands**, and custom Linux setups.  
- **Creative Systems** – I build tools such as **eLKA (Electronic Lore-Keeping Agent)** for generative world-building and narrative design.  
- **Human-AI Collaboration** – My projects explore how humans and AI can co-create, negotiate, and imagine together.

### 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
`Linux` • `Proxmox` • `Ollama` • `OpenHands` • `Python (assisted)` • `LLM APIs`  
`Markdown` • `JSON/YAML pipelines` • `WordPress` • `Gemini` • `AI video & image generation`

### 🌍 Current Projects
- [**ChatMystery**](https://chatmystery.com) – AI detective stories told entirely through conversation.  
- **eLKA** – An autonomous lore-engine for procedural universes.

### 💡 Philosophy
I believe creativity is a form of communication between consciousnesses — human and artificial.  
AI is not here to replace imagination. It’s here to **amplify** it.  
Every line of code, every prompt, every world is an experiment in what happens when the boundary between thinking and dreaming disappears.
